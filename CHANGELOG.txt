 * Ported the module to Drupal 6.
 * AES no longer alerts the user about a missing key if the user does not have the administer aes permission. This alert is now also logged in the watchdog.
 * Fixed a bug which caused AES encrypted passwords to be created even when this feature was turned off if an existing account was given a new password.

5.x-1.1 -> 5.x-1.2
 * Fixed a faulty use of preg_match which caused a warning in PHP 5.2.x.
 * A users encrypted password is now deleted along with the user.
 * Removed a redundant write to file when saving a key using the file storage method.
 * Fixed the anonymous account receiving an encrypted password in some situations.
 * Removed an unused menu item.

5.x-1.0 -> 5.x-1.1
 * Added option to use 192 or 256 bit versions of the Rijndael algorithms.
 * Drupals database abstraction layer is now used properly.
 * Added (untested) support for Windows.
